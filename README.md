# Emotion classification from actors voices with DeepLearning
In this notebook, deep-learning techniques are  applied to classify emotions in the audio domain. Concretelly, 7 cardinal emotions are classified: anger,disgust, fear, happinnes, neutral,surprise and sadness. The dataset uses is the Toronto emotional speech set.

To build the application, the following tasks are programmed:
